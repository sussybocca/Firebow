# Firebow Platform

Firebow is a front-end coding platform that allows users to:

- Edit HTML, CSS, JS files in-browser
- Preview changes live
- Save projects to localStorage
- Deploy HTML projects to Netlify with one click

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Use the sidebar to manage files (add, delete, rename).
3. Edit code in the editor.
4. Click "Preview" to see live changes.
5. Click "Deploy" and enter your Netlify Personal Access Token to publish.

## Notes

- Your main page **must include `firebow.html`**.
- Deployment uses the Netlify API. Make sure you have a personal access token.
- Projects are stored in browser localStorage.
